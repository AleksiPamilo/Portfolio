title: "Go Image Hosting API"
description: "Problem: image upload endpoints are common abuse targets and can leak sensitive metadata. Solution: a security-first Go upload API with X-API-KEY authentication, MIME sniffing, image-dimension limits to block image-bomb style payloads, UUID file naming, and server-side re-encoding that strips EXIF data before storage."
